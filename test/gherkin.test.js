/** TODO> Include some test for lib/gherkin.js
 * For example:
 *  - load the module into an environment that already has a gherkin variable defined
 *  - test if feature, scenario, step's name like string are being matched with a test definition
 *  - test if feature, scenario, step's name like regexp are being matched with a test definition
 *  - test the expected behavoiur>
 *     if a feature(...) contains an scenario and in another place an scenario was written as stand-alone definition
 *     then the stand-alone definition becomes a global definition and the scenario inside the feature belongs
 *     to the feature
 *  - do not accept recursive features, scenarios nor steps!
